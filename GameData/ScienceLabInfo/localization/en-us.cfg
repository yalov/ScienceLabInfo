		#SLI_Large_Crewed_Lab_6_title = Mobile Processing Lab MPL-LG-6
		#SLI_Large_Crewed_Lab_6_desc = It was recently discovered that the assembly instructions are double sided — that explains all the extra parts we had previously. Mobile Processing Lab LG-6 can now seat six, so you are able to conduct really-long-term experiments — store more data you collect in the field, store more science you transmit back home. Now you need at least 3 scientists for supporting this epic brainstorm. Every additional scientist or more skilled scientist will increase research speed.

		#SLI_TechLab_title = Mobile Processing Lab MPL-DSD-2
		#SLI_TechLab_desc = No longer you are limited to research facilities only on Kerbin! This lab compresses an astonishing amount of science equipment and science tools, that is able to increase scientist's productivity twice. The remaining working habitation is suitable for two scientists.

// Default Lab: No longer are you limited to research facilities only on Kerbin!  With the Mobile Processing Lab, you can conduct long-term experiments and ongoing research with the data you collect in the field.  Be sure to check back on your scientists from time to time, and transmit the results of their research home! This model is guaranteed to spontaneously combust less than previous models, and also has the equipment necessary to clean out and restore functionality to inoperable experiments.
