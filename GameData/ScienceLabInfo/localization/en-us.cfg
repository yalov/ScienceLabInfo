		#SLI_Large_Crewed_Lab_6_title = Mobile Processing Lab MPL-LG-6
		#SLI_Large_Crewed_Lab_6_desc = It was recently discovered that the assembly instructions are double sided — that explains all the extra parts we had previously. Mobile Processing Lab LG-6 can now seat six, so you can conduct really-long-term experiments — store more data you collect in the field, store more science you transmit back home. Now you need at least 3 scientists for supporting this epic brainstorm. Every additional skilled scientist will increase research speed.
